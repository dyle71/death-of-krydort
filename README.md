# death-of-krydort

**The not entirely surprising death of Krydort Wolvirry, merchant of 
Kaedwen, finding himself suddenly floating in the North Sea alongside a 
ship of undead Nilfgardians.**

A Table-Top Witcher 3 RPG Dice game system evaluator

## Rationale

I'm part of a small RPG group and we are currently running the Witcher 3
table-top RPG game: https://rtalsoriangames.com/witcher-trpg.

However, we were quite dissatisfied and unconvinced on the original game
mechanics rolling a single D10 to resolve challenges.

In particular, I'm playing a merchant of Kaedwen, who is ... well ...
physically not really suited. Basically he good with his wits and can
convince anyone to buy anything. 

Full stop.

Yet, all of a sudden he finds himself in the middle of a storm at sea next
to a Nilfgardian galleon, full of undead warriors. Before he can climb up
the ship he simply needs to survive and swim to the vessel.

The original gameplay states: attribute + skill + D10 > 14 to succeed.

Krydort has a BODY attribute of 6 and an Athletics skill of 0, making the
act of swimming somehow demanding.

This tiny program tries to evaluate different alternatives to:

**The not entirely surprising death of Krydort Wolvirry, merchant of 
Kaedwen, finding himself suddenly floating in the North Sea alongside a 
ship of undead Nilfgardians.**
